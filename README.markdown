I'm maintaining this here now because I need it to continue working for current cube games.
And others should be able reap the benefits of that too.

Added Red Eclipse support http://redeclipse.net/

Cube Server Lister is an application to monitor Cubeengine based game servers, 
like Cube, AssaultCube, Sauerbraten, Red Eclipse, and Blood Frontier. The goal of this project is to provide a fast and 
useful cross-platform server monitor.

Currently it provides the basic functionality like update from masterserver, listing servers, 
and join servers directly. Furthermore it supports some useful features like chat / server filtering, 
playtime statistics and map previews.
